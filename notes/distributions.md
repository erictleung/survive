# Frequently Used Distributions

## R Distributions

For the classical distributions in R, they are usually prefixed with the
following letters.

- **P**robability distribution functions (cdf) (p)
    - Gives the cumulative distribution function
    - In other words, it'll gives you the cumulative percentage of the
      distribution at a given point

```r
pnorm(1.65) # 0.9505
```

- **D**ensity functions (pdf) (d)
    - Gives the density distribution function
    - In other words, it gives you the actual value of the distribution at a
      given point

```r
dnorm(1)   # 0.8413
dnorm(100) # 0
```

- **Q**uantile functions (q)
    - Given a quantile, it'll return the value that'll give you that quantile if
      you were to input the value into the probability distribution function
    - In other words, it'll inverse the probability distribution function

```r
dnorm(0.9505) # 1.65
```

- **R**andom number generation (r)
    - Produces random numbers generated by the distribution function
    - In other words it'll give you random values that the probability density
      function outputs

```r
rnorm() # -0.2577
rnorm() # 1.098
...
```

## The Exponential Distribution

Also known as the negative exponential distribution.

```r

```

## The Weibull Distribution

## The Extreme (Minimum) Value Distribution

## The Log-Normal Distribution

## The Log-Logistic Distribution

## The Gamma Distribution
